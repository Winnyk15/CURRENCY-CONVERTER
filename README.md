# Description
Currency is a generally accepted form of payment, usually issued by a government and circulated within its jurisdiction.
The value of any currency fluctuates constantly in relation to other currencies. The currency exchange market exists as a means of profiting from those fluctuations.
Many countries accept the U.S. dollar for payment, while others peg their currency value directly to the U.S. dollar.
